  <p class="text-xl font-bold">Uncommon Bug Example</p>
  <p class="text-gray-600">This is a sample paragraph that might contain the bug, which is related to the unexpected behavior of a Tailwind CSS class (e.g., a pseudo-class selector like :hover or :focus that doesn't work as expected, or an interaction between two classes leading to undesired styles).  Consider the situation where you have a hover effect that doesn't properly apply due to other CSS rules, z-index issues or conflict of specificity, or a custom component not receiving the expected style.</p>
